 *
 * In this case, either the given time was not yet reached, or the
 * current time wrapped around. If the given time is farest in the
 * future than half of the whole time scale, we consider it reached and
 * assume a wrap around happened.
 *
 * Now consider the other case:
 *
 * |---------------------------------------------|
 *    \_ given time        \_ current time
 *
 * In this case the time may either be already reached
 * or the given time wrapper around when setting it to
 * the future. We apply the same rule: if the time looks
 * expired for more than half of the whole time scale, we
 * assume that a wrap around happened, and the timer is yet
 * not reached.
